      <h3>Welcome to Settlers Tracker!</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this app is to provide a player the ability to track the
        stats of a game of Settlers of Catan as you are playing, on a turn by
        turn basis. Previously completed games can be viewed under the Previous
        Games tab, allowing you to see the previous game stats. Just a fun way
        to keep up with how games went, who won, how many f***ing fours were
        rolled, etc.
      </p>
    </div>
